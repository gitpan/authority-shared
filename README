NAME
    authority::shared - a multi-AUTHORITY method for your classes

SYNOPSIS
     package MyApp;
     BEGIN { $MyApp::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:JOE'; }
     use authority::shared qw(cpan:ALICE cpan:BOB);
 
     package main;
     use feature qw(say);
     say MyApp->AUTHORITY;  # says "cpan:JOE"
     MyApp->AUTHORITY('cpan:JOE');    # lives
     MyApp->AUTHORITY('cpan:ALICE');  # lives
     MyApp->AUTHORITY('cpan:BOB');    # lives
     MyApp->AUTHORITY('cpan:CAROL');  # croaks

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to indicate that your module is issued by
    multiple authorities. The package variable $AUTHORITY should still be
    used to indicate the primary authority for the package.

    This module does two simple things:

    1. Creates an @AUTHORITIES array in the caller package, populating it
    with the arguments passed to "authority::shared" on the "use" line.
    2. Exports an AUTHORITY function to your package that reads the
    $AUTHORITY and @AUTHORITIES package variables.

    The main use case for shared authorities is for team projects. The team
    would designate a URI to represent the team as a whole. For example,
    "http://datetime.perl.org/", "http://moose.iinteractive.com/" or
    "http://www.perlrdf.org/". Releases can then be officially stamped with
    the authority of the team using:

     use authority::shared q<http://www.perlrdf.org/>;

    And users can check they have an module released by the official team
    using:

     RDF::TakeOverTheWorld->AUTHORITY(q<http://www.perlrdf.org/>);

    which will croak if package RDF::TakeOverTheWorld doesn't have the
    specified authority.

BUGS
    An obvious limitation is that this module relies on honesty. Don't
    release modules under authorities you have no authority to use.
